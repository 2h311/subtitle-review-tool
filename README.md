Code a Subtitle Review Tool - to scan and flag subtitle text for "bad words/phrases"

SUMMARY:  This project is for Yippee.tv, a children's video streaming platform for Christian families.
We need a way to run our subtitle files through some sort of "checker" to make sure they don't contain any curse words or phrases that don't match our brand.
This project would be to create that filter/tool/checker.

PROJECT: You would create a computer app/program/script etc.
that would allow us to upload our subtitle files and scan the text.  

A few specifics:
-Ideally this should accommodate uploading individual files or bulk uploading several files.
-The subtitle file types that would need to be supported are ".srt" and ".scc" (see attached)
-The software should flag/highlight any of the words/phrases listed on the attached document
-For bonus points, it'd be amazing if the software would allow us to also edit/replace any of the trigger words and re-export a new version of the file.

**Please review the .srt/.scc text subtitle file type and confirm you understand the mechanics of what this would involve** (a sample .srt & .scc file is attached)

DELIVERABLES:
-Computer software/app/plugin/etc. that can scan subtitle files and identify (and replace?) words from our exclusion list
-The UX design wouldn't need to be fancy, it'd just need to work.
