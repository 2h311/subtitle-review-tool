[doctor] Now reaching
the right side of the colon.

10
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,833
That looks pretty clean.

11
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,833
And there's the ileocecal valve
which is patent,

12
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,916
and it looks fine.

13
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,083
Prep looks good.

14
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,000
Looks like he's well cleaned out.

15
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
Going up the sigmoid colon.

16
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,250
A few scattered diverticula there.

17
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,625
Heading towards the splenic flexure now.

18
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,041
That looks clean.

19
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,541
In the mid transverse colon.

20
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,833
Wait a second.
That looks like a flat polyp there.

21
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,541
Probably about 2 cm.

22
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,458
Gonna take some biopsies of that.

23
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,916
-Yussi, I'm a block away.
-[Yussi] <i>Where  the fuck are you, man?</i>

24

<i>-</i>Arno? Tell 'em I'm coming up now!

[man] 30 inches. That's like
about 35 carats in there.

32

34
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,666

How do you feel?

39
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,291
It was good.
They'll call me with the results.

40
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,500

-I'm Howard.
-Phil.

50
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,416
[Howard] You didn't bring 'em any water?

51
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,166
I'm good on the water. I don't really
need water. Thank you anyway.

52
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,833
This is...
This is our own spring water.

-[Cash] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,583
All right. So, I gotta tell you
I'm in a bit of a rush.

56

I've not much time because I gotta go--

57

[Phil] What did I tell you?

58
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,625
I said, "No water."
Didn't I tell you "no water"?

59
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,875
I think it's in your best interest
that you find some time for you and I.

60
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,958
[Howard] Let me get you that.

61
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,541
-[Phil] All right. We're on the same page.
-We're on the same page.

62
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,875
-You all right?
-[Howard] Oh, yeah. 100% fine.

63
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,625
It's good. I'll handle it.
I'll handle it. It's good.

00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,166
[Phil] We got every right
to fucking be here.

166
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,541
Ask the owner. Fuck you!

167
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,041
[bodyguard] You and your man get--

168
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,250
-Whoa, whoa!
-Get your man and get the fuck out!

169
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,166
[Howard] Hey, hey, hey, get out.

170
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,208
-Get the fuck out.
-[all clamoring]

171
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,833
-[bodyguard] What?
-Fuck you, man!

172
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,875
[Phil] You just got involved
in something you shouldn't have.

173
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,625
-Fuck is going on?
-[Phil] Hear me? That's on you, asshole.

174
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,875
-I--
-[Phil] You see this?

175
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,583
I don't know these fucking guys.

176
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,416
You're dead, fucker. You're dead.

177
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,125
-I--
-[Phil] You think I'm playing games?

178
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,916
-Get your laugh off now, asshole.
-[Howard] But I didn't do nothing.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,208
When I'm shoveling the dirt
over your fucking head,

180
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,625
we'll see how funny it is then!

181
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,333
[David] I have clients in the office.
Disgraceful.

182
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,416
Turn around and walk away.

183
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,583
[Howard] We're good.
David, go back inside.

184
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,833
-Everything's fine.
-You sure?

185
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,875
-Turn around and walk away!
-[Howard] That's my...

186
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,333
-That's my shop.
-[man] Everybody back in.

187
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,291
-Hello, open the door.
-[man] Let's go.

188
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,833
-[buzzer sounds]
-Okay. Jesus.

189
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,041
You with KG?

190
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,291
Okay, well, you gotta shut that door.
It's KG, huh?

191
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,875
-Is that closed?
-[buzzer sounds]

192
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,000
[KG] That's my man?

193
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,041
[man 1] This is insane,
they just beat Yussi up.

194
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,083
Howard, Howard,
what the fuck is going on, man?

195
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,041
They tried to fuck Yussi up.
Look at his shirt...

196
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,000
Look at his fucking shirt.
Look at his shirt!

197
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,333
-[Howard] Okay.
-[man 2] ...it's a yellow...

198
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,458
Listen, hey, thanks
for the security, by the way.

199
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,583
Send those bitches back
to Paramus or Bay Ridge, yeah.

200
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,708
You take that and charge it up for me?

201
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,541
All I got is fucking Yussi to protect me.

202
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,125
[indistinct chatter]

203
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,166
-Yo, yo. Hey, let us talk.
-What's good with you, man?

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,125
What's up? What's up with the...
Did Amar'e have fucking time on the clock?

205
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,750
Come on, no time on the clock.

206
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,708
-[Howard] You're waving him off.
-[KG] You serious?

207
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,000
-Referee right now?
-[Howard] Come on.

208
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,750
-I like the earrings.
-You like these?

209
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,958
-Those look great.
-I was checking out some rings.

210
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,500
-Last time you cleaned 'em?
-Talking about?

211
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,375
-[Howard] Let me clean this for you.
-He can clean 'em real quick.

212
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,583
Let me throw 'em
in the ultrasonic for you for free.

213
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,250
[KG] What's this gonna cost me?

214
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,750
-[Howard] For free.
-For real?

215
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,666
Won't cost nothing.
The fuck you talking-- Nah.

216
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,125
I'd think you'd have
bigger rocks than that.

217
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,875
-You're a big guy.
-[man 2] That's why we're here.

218
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,333
See what y'all got in here.

219
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,541
[Howard] Who'd win in a fight?
Ben Wallace or Tony Allen?

220
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,208
-TA all day.
-[Howard] Oh, yeah?

221
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,625
-Look at this shit here.
-What is that?

222
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,583
[man 4] ...the fuck out of here.

223
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,708
What's that, a gremlin?
Iced-out gremlin down here?

224
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,958
-This ugly motherfucker right here--
-[Howard] Furby?

225
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,958
[Demany] ...animal
or some kind of fucking...

226
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,166
Some toy, or some shit,
and he'll just bling the bitch out.

227
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,250
I bling this.

228
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,500
Used to work with niggas
on early music videos, all that shit.

229
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,916
He like the first nigga to start all that.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,791
-Are you serious?
-I started this shit.

231
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,625
-[Demany] Show him the eyes.
-Yeah.

232
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,416
All right, so I did this.
So it fucks with you.

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
[all laugh]

234
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,541
-Are you serious?
-[Howard] There it is.

235
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,333
[laughter continues]

236
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,083
How's that? How's that?

237
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,833
-It scares the shit out of people.
-[KG] Look at that.

238
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,541
[Demany] It's a fucking
older model, but it's dope.

239
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,541
-[Howard] Listen...
-[man 3] You could put that shit back.

240
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,625
-This shit was slamming.
-[KG] I gotta...

241
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,208
What's the length?
Let me see the chain on that.

242
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,791
-That's an 18, but I can get you a 14.
-[KG] Look like a Gremlin or something.

243
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,166
[Howard] KG. Doc know you're here,
by the way?

244
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,375
No, he doesn't.
And let's keep it that way.

245
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,291
It's game night.
You should be stretching out.

246
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,791
-[Demany] Fucking insane, man.
-What is he, a coach?

247
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,208
-Just a fucking crazy-ass Jew.
-[man 3] T, look at this shit.

248
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,333
[Howard] Throw these in the ultrasonic.

249
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,958
-As soon as the other stuff is done.
-No, now.

250
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,458
-We got a nigga that's--
-[Howard] KG, I wouldn't lean on that.

251
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,833
-Yo.
-I wouldn't lean on it.

252
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,500
Kevin was telling me
he looking for watches.

253
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,125
-You looking for watches?
-Uh-huh.

254
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:37,458
Let's go to the wall of watches
right there... What are we talking? AP?

255
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,666
-I was thinking about the Prezi.
-Right.

256
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,750
That one you got
that crazy-ass deal for?

257
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,250
That one for 16.
That crazy one though. You know?

258
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,041
Yeah. The, uh, 16, yeah,
you're right. Right.

259
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,166
[KG] The Prezi.

260
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,708
-Look at this, right here.
-[woman] Wow, okay.

261
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,041
-Boom.
-Right.

262
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,208
That's a small watch for a big man.

263
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,250
-[Demany] Look at the detail in there.
-Yeah.

264
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,583
-You got papers for this?
-[Howard] No, hey...

265
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,291
-Of course--
-I don't have a box or papers.

266
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,500
I don't have either one.
What are you talking about?

267
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,458
-You sold me this shit, dummy.
-[Howard] I don't remember that.

268
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,958
Listen, niggas call
niggas out for this, man.

269
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,250
Of course.
If you don't have the box or pap--

270
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,666
You find me one nigga
with a KMH watch they call out.

271
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,416
-Huh?
-[Howard] It's a moot point,

272
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,125
Demany, because
I don't have these, all right?

273
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,208
So how about we move on
to the diamonds here?

274
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,583
Listen, you got a girl?
Why don't you get your girl a treat?

275
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,166
[Julia] He doesn't have a girlfriend.

276
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,125
-[KG] Says who?
-Says you.

277
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,250
-Hey.
-[KG] How you know if I got a girlfriend?

278
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,916
Howard, get the fuck over here.

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,458
-[Julia] 'Cause you told me.
-[KG] I never said that.

280
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,291
-[Demany] What are you doing?
-What's up?

281
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,250
Why didn't you bring
the goddamn watches out?

282
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,333
-I'm not doing that.
-The nigga would have bought one.

283
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,375
I told you,
you can keep 'em in my safe.

284
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't want you selling 'em
out of my showroom. You understand me?

285
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,791
Fucking dumbass. Where the fuck am I gonna
sell 'em, nigga? On the goddamn street?

286
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,916
-That's not my problem.
-That ain't your problem?

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,041
-No--
-That ain't--

288
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,666
He don't like shit in this dusty
motherfucking tin-foil filled--

289
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,083
Yes, he does. He's having
a fucking ball here. What are you--

290
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,833
What the fuck is he gonna buy?
A goddamn Furby, nigga?

291
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,500
Fuck you. All right?

292
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,541
I'ma take his ass to Flawless,
I'm not fucking with you today.

293
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,750
-You're not taking them to Flawless.
-Since you acting like a bitch--

294
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,083
KG, do me a favor?
Don't lean on that, please.

295
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,125
[doorbell chimes]

296
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,416
-[Demany] You acting stupid.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay.

297
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Buzz him in, buzz him in now. Now.

298
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,791
[buzzer sounds]

299
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,791
Oh, my God, is this...
This is it! This is it.

300
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,833
-Hey.
-What's up?

301
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,750
[Howard] Okay, look at this.

302
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,416
A package from Fishtonic,
where you want this?

303
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,375
Bring it in, go to my office.
KG? Don't you dare leave, okay?

304
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,500
What's in this package
is gonna blow your mind, KG.

305
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,791
-Is it heavy?
-Yes.

306
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,500
Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, my God.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,583
What you got? Give me that.

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,958
[knocks]

309
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,000
[muffled chatter]

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,458
-Man, I can't do this anymore, bro.
-What happened?

311
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,208
What happened? Your street goons,
they attacked me.

312
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,958
[Howard] What did you say
to piss them off?

313
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,083
Listen, Garnett's crew came in here,
they took a look around,

314
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,750
see these guys, they're like,
"Who works here? Who doesn't?

315
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,708
Who doesn't, get out."
I said, "These guys don't work here."

316
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,708
That was stupid.
You shouldn't have said that.

317
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,750
These guys grabbed me,
dragged me over the counter,

318
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,916
ripped my shirt,
got me looking like a fool.

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,583
Here. Take this. That's a Gucci shirt.
It's $500, it's brand new.

320
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,166
Are you fucking serious right now?

321
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,041
-The tag's still on it.
-It ain't about the shirt.

322
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,416
I gave you eight years of my life,
look how you treat me.

323
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,583
I put in everything into this business.

324
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,416
I saved your ass a thousand times.
I can't take this place anymore, man.

325
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,250
I can't deal with your problems
every other day.

326
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,916
There's a lot of people on this block
that would love to do business with me.

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,916
When you see me working with them,
you're not gonna like it, gonna be jealous.

328
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,000
You're not gonna like it, Howard.

329
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,750
Howard? Hello.

330
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,083
I'm standing here, man.

331
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,833
There's a lot of people I could be doing
business with other than you.

332
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,000
You're falling apart.

333
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,666
You're looking like a fool out here
in the Diamond District.

334
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,083
Looking through fucking fish.

335
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,250
Come on,
I gave you eight years of my life

336
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:15,375
and you can't even fucking talk to me
and look me in the eyes?

337
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,916
Man to fucking man?

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,458
Holy shit, I'm gonna cum.

339
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,875
Hey, fuck you, man.
I'm finished with this shithole.

340
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,416
Hey, yo, KG? KG?

341
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,458
-Yo. Hey.
-Howard, Yussi is gone.

342
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,958
-That's fine with me.
-Gone for good.

343
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,583
Let me get a phone from you.

344
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,000
KG, you've gotta come here. All right?

345
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,125
-I gotta show you something.
-I gotta leave soon.

346
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,791
-I know. Listen to me.
-I gotta get out.

347
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,458
Okay, so I'm watching TV
like a year ago, all right.

348
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,291
I'm watching one of those History Channel
shows, trying to learn shit.

349
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,500
And I stumble...

350
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,375
-You ever hear of African Jews?
-African Jews?

351
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,916
-Yeah. No?
-[Demany laughing]

352
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,375
-Nigga want everybody to be a Jew.
-Check this out, I know, all right?

353
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,208
So these are black Jews. All right?

354
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,875
They're stranded in the middle
of Ethiopia. It's deep shit.

355
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,750
-Stranded?
-Yeah, lookit.

356
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,791
They got nothing.
They don't got cars, they don't got shit.

357
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,041
And I'm watching this, and I'm like,
"What are these guys wearing?"

358
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,875
Look, it's on the Torah there,
it's everywhere, right?

359
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:24,375
It's a fuck-- Where do these fucking guys
get precious black opals?

360
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,125
-That's what that is.
-It's a black opal?

361
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,083
I do my research.

362
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,916
These guys live near the Welo mines,
which primarily is red opal.

363
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,666
-Which aren't worth shit.
-Okay.

364
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,166
But these, you can't get your hands
on these things, you understand?

365
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,083
[KG] Really?

366
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,875
So, look. I say to myself,
"How do I get a hold of these guys?"

367
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,666
And I've managed to track these guys down.
I buy one from 'em.

368
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,000
-[KG] Holy... What is that? [laughs]
-What is that? That's right here.

369
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,750
That's the rock. That's the rock.
That's the stone. I got this.

370
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,875
-[KG] Look how it's winking in the light.
-[Demany] How you get this shit?

371
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,208
It took me 17 months
to get this thing, okay?

372
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,250
-[KG] Holy...
-[Howard] Just look at this. Hang on.

373
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,500
Go through my loupe. Be careful.
That's my best loupe.

374
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,625
Let's see this...

375
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,083
-[Howard] Look at it.
-[Demany] You're into that motherfucker.

376
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,000
[KG] Oh, wow.

377
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,833
-[Howard] Isn't that the shit?
-[KG] What?

378
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,583
-That's history right there. Understand?
-How many carats is this?

379
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,291
A good, what, 4- 5,000 carats?
$3,000 a carat?

380
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,250
-[KG] What?
-I'm not fucking bullshitting you.

381
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,958
-Why's it got so many colors in it?
-[Howard] That's the thing.

382
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,458
They say you can see
the whole universe in opals,

383
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,375
that's how fucking old they are.

384
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,291
-[KG] Holy snap...
-[Howard] I'm telling you.

385
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,458
-That's why I wanted you to see it.
-I gotta have this.

386
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,166
[Demany] Your ass crazy, man.

387
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,500
From stone to stone.
Garnet's a stone, you know that.

388
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,416
That's a million-dollar opal
you're holding.

389
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,125
Straight from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.

390
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,458
I mean, this is old-school
Middle-earth shit.

391
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,875
[Demany] Got a motherfucking
dinosaur gem in this...

392
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,833
[Howard] The dinosaurs, that's right,

393
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,416
the dinosaurs fucking stared
at this thing.

394
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,000
<i>It's 110 million years old. At the least.</i>

395
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,625
<i>-Some deep shit.</i>
-[Demany] <i>Fuck basketball.</i>

396
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,291
[Howard] <i>Can't lean on the glass, KG.</i>

397
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,833
[man 1] Oh. Shit.

398
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,333
-[clamoring]
-[Howard] Fuck.

399
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,083
-You all right?
-[KG] Yeah.

400
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,541
I told you not to lean.

401
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,083
-Get a towel or something.
-[KG] Chill. I'm good.

402
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,125
You heard me. I did tell him
not to lean. You all right?

403
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,708
[Demany] Don't cut your fucking self.

404
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,708
-Give him a napkin.
-That's a sign. That's a sign I need this.

405
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,000
That's what this is.

406
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,041
-[man] Make sure my nigga good.
-[KG] Straight.

407
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,583
[Howard] Fucking glass,
it's a lot of weight you were putting...

408
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,875
That's a sign. I need this.

409
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,750
-I need this right here.
-I-- Listen, it's not for sale.

410
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,291
I can't sell it to you.

411
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,000
-What do you mean, it's not for sale?
-I can't do it. That...

412
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,208
-God damn it, it's set for auction.
-[Julia] Just give it to him.

413
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,958
Why the fuck would you show me something
if I couldn't have it?

414
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,791
The fuck would you bring this out?

415
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,916
I was excited,
decided to share it with you.

416
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,250
Let me hold it for a night then.
Let me wear it to the game tomorrow.

417
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,750
It would be cool, I'm going to the game,
I'll grab it from you,

418
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,125
then meet you at Adley's
tomorrow morning, first thing.

419
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,541
Cool, boom, just like that. It's perfect.

420
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,958
-[Demany] Come on.
-[Julia] One night.

421
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,208
-[KG] You serious?
-I can't.

422
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,291
-[Julia] It's one night.
-They'll pull it from the auction...

423
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,208
-[KG] You don't understand.
-[man] Come on, man.

424
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,500
[KG] This stone,
I'm really connecting with this.

425
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,541
I feel like I'ma have
40 or 50 on this, man.

426
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,000
-[man 1] Man...
-[man 2] That energy.

427
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,458
-[man 1] Yeah, boy.
-You understand?

428
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,833
-[man 2] Yeah.
-[KG] Understand that?

429
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,250
[Demany] That's what I'm talking about.
This shit speaking to him.

430
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,333
[KG] I'ma destroy Philly tonight
with this.

431
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,500
-[Demany] Inspiring.
-[KG] Bitch-ass niggas. This fucking thing

432
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,000
-makes me feel like I can fly.
-Shit.

433
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,291
-[Demany] Hear that?
-[man] Let him get that.

434
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,541
You're going to @me at HowieBling.

435
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,375
-Yes.
-[Howard] 30 fucking pics I want liked.

436
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,416
-Yes, I got you.
-[Demany] You talking about @me.

437
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,750
[Howard] Let me get a fucking shot.

438
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,541
-[Demany] That's a good idea, my nigga.
-Come here.

439
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,416
-[KG] Phew. Jump in here.
-So you hold it up.

440
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,708
[Demany] Get me in that bitch, too.

441
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,750
-[Howard] Boom.
-[KG] Boom.

442
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,708
-Cool.
-[man] Yes.

443
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:32,791
-All right.
-[KG] All right.

444
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,791
I can't just--

445
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,291
-Give me the Celtic ring. I want the ring.
-[Demany] Come the fuck on.

446
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,833
-Collateral. Make sure he brings it back.
-No. He's good money.

447
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,750
-I know he's good for it.
-[KG] Know what? That's a deal.

448
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,125
-[Howard] Wanna make sure he remembers.
-[KG] I give you that.

449
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,333
[Howard] Thanks. All right,
I'll keep it right here.

450
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,375
-Next to my Knicks '73, classic.
-[KG] Classic, I like that.

451
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,333
-[Howard] I appreciate your understanding.
-Gotcha, right.

452
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,791
All right, listen, you meet me at...

453
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,708
[Demany] I'll meet your happy ass. Yes.

454
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,916
[Howard] You will fucking bring
that stone to me 9:00 in the morning.

455
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,166
Listen to me, no dicking around.
You'll show up, you hear me?

456
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,583
Chill. I'll see you there, motherfucker.

457
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,291
-All right, let's roll. Let's do it.
-[man] You better have 50 tonight.

458
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,125
-[KG] I'm outta here.
-Buzz 'em out.

459
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,041
-[buzzer sounds]
-I got his earrings.

460
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,500
The earrings. Wait! Bring it out to him.

461
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,750
-Keep 'em till tomorrow, I'll grab 'em.
-[Howard] KG, no.

462
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,958
-Black Jew power, nigga. He's so extra.
-[clicks tongue]

463
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,666
Fucking, I don't know.

464
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,250
What the fuck--

465
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,875
Who's gonna clean this fucking shit?

466
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:26,791
[buzzer sounds]

467
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,958
Eddie boy, what are you doing?

468
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,166
<i>What do you want, Dad?</i>

469
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,125
Look what I got. Look,
you're gonna love this. Here, hey.

470
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,333
-[man] Howard.
-[Howard] What's that there?

471
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,750
Will you leave me alone?

472
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,750
<i>-What is it?</i>
-This is Kevin Garnett's ring.

473
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,375
Championship ring, NBA 2008.
I knew you'd freak out.

474
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,375
<i>Sick.</i>

475
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,250

-[Bronstein] Hey, Howard.

Hey. Break out your tray,
where is it? Where is it?

-Got the tray. What you got?
-I'd shake your hand,

but I know where it's been. Look at this.

481
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,250
It's Kevin Garnett's
2008 Championship ring.

482
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,375
-Championship ring?
-[Howard] Championship ring. 2008.

483

You wanna pawn it or sell it?

484

I wanna pawn it, I wanna pawn it.

485
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,375
-Let me take a look.
-I don't know what you're looking for.

486
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,750
-[Steve] Check the diamonds.
-[Howard] It was just on his finger.

487
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,791
It's single cut. It's not even full cut.

488
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,833
-[Howard] Talk to the league...
-Steve, take a look.

489
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,333
-...about the way they cut their shit.
-But they're worth less.

490
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,208
Take a look at this. All right?

491
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,625
[Bronstein] It's his ring. I understand.

492
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,041
[Howard] That's from his Instagram.
It's blowing up right now.

493
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,250
I hear you. So what do you need for it?

494
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,625
I figure that thing's worth 80 grand?

495
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,458
Just loan it to me. That's it.
Float it to me. I'll be back Friday.

496
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,750
Number one,
we both know what's in here.

497
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:44,666
We both know the value is mostly
'cause it's memorabilia.

498
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,000
It is a memorabilia piece.

499
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,583
-That's why you're gonna sell it, right?
-[Steve] So, I tell you what.

500
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,666
Give me 50 Gs. Just float it to me.

501
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm gonna give you $25,000,
but I want an 8% vig on the ring.

502
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,000
Eight percent? Fucking--
How about I give you a grand?

503
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,833
You can take a grand off the top.
I'm gonna come back Friday for it.

504
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,750
Last time, you left something here
for six months.

505
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,875
We wanna make sure up front.

506
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,541
Last time wasn't my fault.
We fucking went over that.

507
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:10,875
I understand.
Let's make it quick. $21,000, 7% vig,

508
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,250

you say you'll be back Friday.

Are we going inside the facility
or we gonna meet him out here?

793
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,958
-Just chill the fuck out.
-I hope we see Rondo there.

794
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,875
Love to tell him "Thank you"
for dropping all those dimes.

795
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,625
Man, no, that's not-- They busy.

796
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,583
What the fuck is it with you
Jewish niggas and basketball, anyway?

797
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,750
Huh? Obsessed.

798
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,833
I'll have you know, the first two points
scored in the NBA was a Jew.

799
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,166
Yeah, yeah. Who was it, Fred Flintstein?

800
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,541
No. Ossie Schectman, 1946,
played for the Knicks.

801
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,625
Here we go. Yeah, this is
where the big boys play.

802
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:49,916
...always, always
gotta practice, and always got--

803
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,791
Look at this, this is sick. Sick, my God.

804
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,791
Hey, check this out. Yeah.

805
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,333
Cookies.

806
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,666
-[man] Yo, man.
-[Howard] Rondo's coming up.

807
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,666
He can't help himself.
He's gonna have to finish. And he scores.

808
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,041
-[man] Can you give us an update?
-[Demany] I need to get through.

809
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,750
Sorry, brother.

810
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,666
[man] What's changing for game two?

811
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,041
[Howard] Demany?

812
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,708
-[woman] I got one coming back.
-What's up? I'm with him.

813
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,208
-Whoa.
-No, no, I'm with him.

814
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,333
-Demany. What the fuck?
-[woman] Excuse me, excuse me?

815
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,416
What's he fucking...

816
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,791
-Hey, hi.
-I'm with him.

817
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:24,791
-I came with him.
-You didn't--

818
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,000
-You saw me walk through the door.
-I didn't see you walk through the door.

819
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,041
-What's your name?
-I won't be on a list, I came with him.

820
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,541
-What's your name, sir?
-I came with him.

821
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:35,500
What the fuck is he doing to me?
Cocksucker fucking works for me.

822
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,083
[Dinah] Is Marcel excited?

823
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,000
-[Eiline] I think she's a little nervous.
-[Dinah] Little, it's the lead play.

824
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,750
[Eiline] I know. We're very proud of her.

825
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,833
Yeah, yeah. And Danny's got a role, too.

826
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:48,875
-Small part. He's nervous. But...
-But that's good, yeah.

827
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:50,500
-[Dinah] ...nothing fazes him.
-[Eric] Working?

828
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:53,208
-He said she was amazing.
-[Howard] Yeah. One second.

829
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,291
-Sure.
-What are you guys doing for the break?

830
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,416
Oh. Um...

831
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,458
We're not doing anything this year.

832
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,958
-[Eiline] Oh, really?
-Yeah.

833
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:01,875
[Eric] Wow.

834
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,583
-[Eiline] That's not like you guys.
-[Eric] How come?

835
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:06,541
-Howard, how come? Howard?
-[Eiline] Everything okay?

836
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,458
Howard?

837
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,458
No vacation?

838
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:15,291
No, we're... next year, we're gonna take
a bigger trip, saving up for that.

839
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,541
-Gonna go to Europe.
-Oh, that's nice.

840
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:21,500
So, uh, yeah, do a little culture.
These kids are becoming morons.

841
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,250
Well... Tsk.

842
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,208
-Oh, yeah. Well...
-We'll be morons in Cancún.

843
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,208
Right. Especially on the trapeze.

844
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,666
Good luck to Danny tonight.

845
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,000
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

846
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,666
-We just talked about Danny.
-[Eric] Good.

847
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,583
Okay.

848
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,666
What are you gonna do for Passover?
Is your sister coming?

849
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,833
-Yeah.
-What are you doing? Who you got?

850
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:42,458
Watching for LeBron. I got six different
people playing six different games.

851
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,833
[Howard] Hey, we're all making sac--

852
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:46,125
-Hey. Who tapped me? Who was that?
-[Dinah] And I don't cook,

853
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,250
so they give me shit about that.

854
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,500
-[Howard] Who is it?
-[Eiline] Gefilte fish?

855
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,750
[Eiline] That'll be nice.
You gonna do the questions?

856
00:41:58,833 --> 00:41:59,666
[Dinah] Yeah.

857
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,458
[Eiline] The four questions, yeah?
You practicing?

858
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,000
[Beni] I've been practicing.

859
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,166
[Eiline] I don't know how we're gonna keep
it in Mexico with the whole <i>matzah.</i>

860
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,500
-[Dinah] You kidding?
-[Eiline] Yeah.

861
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:08,833
[Dinah laughs]

862
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,791
[Eiline] Well, good luck to Marcel.

863
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,458
[Dinah] I know, and to Danny.

864
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,375
Where are you going?

865
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,125
Daddy's gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

866
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,333
[Dinah] She's gonna be on
in just a second.

867
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,000
I'll be back. Thank you.

868
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,958
Howard. Marcel is about to get on--

869
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,166
[Howard] Okay. I'll be right back.

870
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,250
[Eiline] Everything okay?

871
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,250
-This is fucked up, guys.
-What's so fucked up about it?

872
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,583
Can I speak to you guys outside?

873
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,041
Sure you wanna do that? Yeah?
All right.

874
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,083
Excuse me.

875
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,500
Hey. What are we gonna
do here, man?

876
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,750
-Hey, yo.
-Come on, man.

877
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,041
That's my family!

878
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,875
Get the fuck off, motherf-- [screaming]

879
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,666
[indistinct shouting]

880
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,708
Okay, look out.
You're going to be great.

881
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:08,791
[door handle rattles]

882
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:11,916
Are you kidding me,
how good you guys look.

883
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,250
Dad, what are you doing?

884
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,000
-Marcel, break a leg. We're all here...
-What are you doing here?

885
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,458
[panting]

886
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,750
[tires squealing]

887
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,083
Fuck.

888
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:37,958
[inaudible]

889
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,000
-[man] Get him, get him.
-Fuck.

890
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,625
Fucking shit.

891
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,708
[man] Come here, you motherfucker.

892
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:56,833
Hey, fuck you. Fuck you!

893
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,791
-Ah, fuck!
-[car horn honking]

894
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,541
[groans]

895
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,791
[man] Come on. Get up.

896
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:08,416
[Howard] Okay. Come on. I'm walking,
I'm coming. I'm coming.

897
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,333
[Buddy] Get fucked.

898
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,791
[Howard] Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

899
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:15,166
-Fucking bit me. You fucking cocksucker.
-[Howard] Arno. Hey.

900
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,958
-Get him in the fucking car.
-Arno.

901
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,458
-Get him in the fucking car.
-Arno.

902
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,791
Get him in the car.

903
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,291
Go, go, come on,
let's get outta here. Go, go.

904
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,250
You fucking made me run,
you motherf--

905
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,041
[men clamoring]

906
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,291
Arno, what is happening?

907
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,333
Don't "Arno" me,
don't fucking say my name.

908
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,916
-[man] Give me the--
-Give me the keys.

909
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,166
The fucking Jew bit me.

910
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,083
Arno, hey, hey.
What's happening right now?

911
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:40,458
I told you how things were gonna go
if you didn't start to behave.

912
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:43,583
What? How was I not behaving?
Explain to me, I'm sorry--

913
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:47,791
I think I was very explicit on the phone
about how things were gonna go.

914
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,041
-Like the way things are going now?
-Give me the fucking keys to your car.

915
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,666
-What are you gonna do?
-[Phil] Give me the key.

916
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,291
Have 'em steal my Mercedes?

917
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,458
[Phil] Look what the fuck you did,
you fucking bit me.

918
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,291
Arno. Arno, fucking talk to me.

919
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,666
-Hello, Arno.
-Don't listen to him. It's not a game.

920
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,875
Stop saying my fucking name.

921
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:06,666
I have every intention of paying you back.
I'm broke right now.

922
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,875
You're broke? What's that, motherfucker?

923
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,750
-[Phil] Do you remember that?
-Look at it.

924
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,750
-Does that look familiar?
-That is money that's not mine.

925
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:17,583
That I sent to you because I wanted
to calm you down because--

926
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:20,208
We know for a fact that you placed a bet
with that money.

927
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,208
I never placed a bet with that money.

928
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,583
-[Arno] Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

929
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,916
[Arno] Let me ask you something.

930
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,375
I heard Beni and Eddie
are going to Timberlake.

931
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,416
Know what else I heard?

932
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,625
I heard you've resurfaced
your fucking swimming pool.

933
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,000
-I...
-Know how that makes me feel?

934
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:33,958
-...never resurfaced anything.
-You think your life is

935
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,750
-more important than--
-I don't know who said that.

936
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,791
[Phil] Give me the keys.

937
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:39,166
Shut the fuck up. Give me the keys
to your fucking car. Now!

938
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,125
Have the fucking keys. Fine.

939
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:45,791
All right, listen,
I do, I did, I admit it.

940
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:50,458
I... I... I made a bet, and guess what?

941
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,500
Here's the thing, I hit.
I hit the bet big.

942
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,958
-Okay?
-[Arno] You think I'm stupid?

943
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:59,916
You think I'm stupid, Howard.
You and your whole fucking family.

944
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,291
I'll call the book now.
Get on the phone with him, he'll tell you.

945
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,666
I saw the bookie.
You're talking about Gary?

946
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,458
You spoke to Gary about what?

947
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,958
-About what?
-About you.

948
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:12,291
About how you're taking my money
all over town, placing bets.

949
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:15,541
You know what that does to me,
you know how offensive that is to me?

950
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,625
What? You stopped the bet?

951
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:20,791
What do you think, asshole?

952
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,541
-You stopped the bet?
-Shut the fuck up.

953
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,041
[groans]

about the trunk scenario.

[Marcel] No, that was literally
the most awkward thing, like--

Where are you going?

1052
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,375

1055

...till 2:00, 3:00, you never know
anymore. So I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

1056
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,583
Yeah, okay, sure.

Anyway, I'll finish
the conversation later.

1060

But it was literally so awkward. Like...

1061

Who are you talking to?

1062
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:22,958
Jessica.

1063
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:25,458
Hi, Jessica.
How good was our girl tonight?

1064
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,791
You can't hear her.

1065
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,958
Okay, well, then just
hang up for a second.

1066
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,833
Let me... Let me talk to you.
Two secs.

1067
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,000
I'll call you back.

1068
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:36,166
What?

1069
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,916
So, I just, I was very proud of you
tonight. You were beyond incredible.

1070
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,833
You told me like five times already.

1071
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:47,333
Well, I just wanted... You really,
really to know how proud I was.

1072
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:50,791
Okay? So I really...
I just really, really want you to know.

1073
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,083
Okay, well, I do.

1074

-Everything is cool, right?
-What do you mean?

I would check in with you.

Okay.

1077
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,625
Make sure everything's good.

1078
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,083
Why wouldn't I be good?

1079
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:08,250
I don't know, I just thought I'd check in.

1080
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:11,666
Okay, well, I literally don't know
what you're talking about, so...

1081
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,541
That's right, 'cause I'm an idiot.

1082

1275
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,416
<i>Your opal is one of 75 items</i>
<i>I have to open in this auction.</i>

1276
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,375
Uh... Uh, listen...

1277
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:31,666
<i>All of them but yours have been cleaned,</i>
<i>cataloged and appraised.</i>

1278
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,583
I'm doing some appraisals of my own, okay.

1279
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:34,500
[phone ringing]

1280
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,125
And then I'm gonna
bring it to you today.

1281
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,291
<i>I'm on the precipice</i>
<i>of pulling it right now.</i>

1282
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:39,750
I swear to you, please.

1283
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:42,250
<i>-End of the day or we're done.</i>
-I'm getting a call right now...

1284
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,583
<i>-End of the day, Howard, I'm serious.</i>
-...so I have to go.

1285
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,458
This is Howard Ratner.

1286
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:48,916
-[Janet] <i>How are you?</i>
-Thank you so much

1287
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,125
for calling me back so quickly.

1288
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,541
<i>Yeah, no problem. That message you left,</i>
<i>actually was very disturbing.</i>

1289
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,750
No, no, I didn't mean to worry you.

1290
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,791
<i>-Mind telling me what this is about?</i>
-[phone ringing]

1291
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,625
I saw online that your boss
represents Kevin Garnett.

1292
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,458
<i>I'm gonna have to put you on hold.</i>
<i>One moment.</i>

1293
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,125
Okay, sure, sure, I'll hang on.

1294
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:05,291
[woman] Howard, Julia's on line one.

1295
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,583
No. No. Tell her no.
I'm not here. Fuck it.

1296
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,500
[buttons beep]

1297
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,250
Where are you?

1298
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,250
[Julia] <i>Why aren't you</i>
<i>answering your phone?</i>

1299
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:17,666
I asked you a question. Where are you?

1300
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,708
<i>I stayed at Kat's house.</i>
<i>Where else do you think?</i>

1301
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,708
<i>I couldn't fucking go home</i>
<i>with you acting that way.</i>

1302
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:25,750
No. No. That's... So let me guess,
you're not coming to work today?

1303
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:26,666
<i>I would like to.</i>

1304
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,708
That must be nice to come to work
whenever you feel like it.

1305
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:30,791
<i>Oh, Howard.</i>

1306
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:35,416
Is that... Is that good? Is that good?
Maybe you should take a nap, then.

1307
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,666
-Take a nap, get your rest.
<i>-Can we please talk this out?</i>

1308
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,416
<i>-You're being a baby right now.</i>
-You need to remain attractive, right?

1309
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,375
Answer me.

1310
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,333
<i>I just wanna sit down </i>

1311
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:45,541
<i>-and talk to you, Howard.</i>
-Okay.

1312
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:47,208
<i>I don't wanna do this.</i>
<i>I don't wanna fight.</i>

1313
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:48,875
-And I just need to work, okay?
-[phone ringing]

1314
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,708
I need to work to make sure
that your cheating ass is taken care of.

1315
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:53,875
[Joani] Howard, personnel on line two.

[woman] <i>My assistant told me</i>
<i>that you called? How are you doing?</i>

1319
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,833
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I could be better.

1320
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:03,500
<i>Sorry to hear that. What can I do for you?</i>

1321
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:07,416
I've been having a situation
with one of your higher-profile players,

1322
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,541
and I'm moments away right now
from making things very ugly for you.

1323
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:14,166
<i>-Okay. Can you hang on for a second?</i>
-No, I'm not hanging on.

1324

-I happen to be a litigious individual.
<i>-Mmm.</i>

1325
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:20,208
And I am a second away
from hanging up right now

1326
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,208
-and calling my lawyer and the police...
<i>-Whoa, whoa.</i>

-[doorbell]
-[Joani] Howard, KG is here with Demany.

1328
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:27,166

Go to the other buzzer, please. Hurry up.

1338
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:47,791

-[Howard] Right there, go ahead.
-[buzzer sounding]

1340
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:51,500

01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,583
-Hang on, sorry.
-Open this shit up.

1343

I'm sorry.

We don't got time for this.
He got a game tonight.

1345
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,625
The magnet sometimes doesn't connect.
You brought the gem?

1346
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,583
-I'm claustrophobic.
-[KG] I got the gem right here.

1347
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,083
[Howard] Good. There it is.

1348
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,958
-We're gonna go downstairs and wait.
-You can't leave

1349
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,708
-because that one's locked off.
-We'll wait downstairs.

1350
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:10,291
-Open up.
-Get a fucking hammer.

1351

-What's going on, man?
-Roman. He needs a hammer.

1352
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,916
-[Howard] We'll be right there.
-Let me get a hammer.

1353
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,750
[Howard] I, honestly,
it's gonna be a second.

1354
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:20,791
Move it! Give me the fucking...
Give me the hammer.

1355

I'm on it. I'm coming.

1356
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,375
This usually works. This'll work.
Give me this.

1357
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:27,583
-[KG] Man.
-And get ready to buzz, okay?

1358
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:28,666

[doorbell chimes]

1362
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,208
Buzz. Hit it from the side...

1363
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:35,625
[Joani] Flawless is here.

1364
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:38,125
[Howard] Get rid of this motherfucker.
Tell him goodbye.

1365
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,041
-Oh, my God, Flawless is here?
-We ain't got time for this.

1366

Oh, shit.

1369
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:48,041
[Howard] We're having
a fucking connection issue.

1370
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:50,125
Just get me some fucking metal shavings

1371
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:54,083
and the tool fucking kit, all right?
God damn it.

1372
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:59,125
I'm going to get this open,
I promise you this will work.

1373
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:01,375
-Hurry the fuck up, Roman. Thank you.
-[Roman] Relax.

1374
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:03,166
-Thank you. Thank you.

-Listen to me.

1378
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:09,750
I got $175,000 in this bag.

1379
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:13,208
170... I told you this thing's
worth over a million dollars.

1380
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,416
[Demany] Come on, man.
What the fuck you doing?

1381
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,750
-[Howard] I saw...
-Four courtside seats.

1382
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,708
I live in New York. I don't know
what that's going to do to me.

1383
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:23,333
KG, I wanna give it to you for free.

1384
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:26,166
I'm that kinda guy.
Just, I'm tied into an auction right now.

1385
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,750

1392
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,291
It's perfect, and you know it.

1393
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,166
[Howard] Kevin, I hate
letting you down like this.

1394
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,208
This motherfucker says no
to everything! Say yes to something!

1395

-Go, go.
-[buzzer sounding]

1402
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,125

-[Demany] Jesus Christ, man.
-I'm so sorry.

1404
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,166
Got a door don't work.
What's going on here, man?

1405
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,916
Get them some waters,

1406
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,083
We don't need any water.

1407
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,791
Go get my ring
so I can get up out of here.

1408

Get him his fucking ring.
He got shit to do.

1409
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:12,708
-The ring. The ring. The ring.

1411
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,958
The ring. Oh, my God, no.
I left the fucking ring in Long Island.

1412
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,833
What the fuck do you mean
you left it in Long--

1413
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:20,916
-[groans]
-I'll give it to Demany.

1414

1417
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,208
I don't-- Listen, I can't do this.
I don't have confidence.

1418
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,708
You don't have to do-- I know,
but I need the stone.

-[KG] Do me a favor, you need the stone?
-Yeah.

1420

1583
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,666
He comes over to me and says...

1584
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,958
"Happy holidays." Like it's Christmas.

1585
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,833
It's like having an intruder
in your own home.

1586
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:37,416
[man] And we'll never live it down.

1587
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,208
He's not bothering anybody
though, right? He's trying.

1588
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:42,958
[Gooey] Yeah, easy for you to say.
He didn't marry your daughter. Shh.

1589
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:47,083
[man] You know who sells the vitamins
on Amazon, he's got the lisp.

1590
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,583
[Howard] Here he is.

1591
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,125
All good.

1592
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,750
[man 1] ...got the sprained ankle,
so, the guy's a schmuck.

1593
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:56,291
[man 2] Man, KG wouldn't even dare
mess with Amar'e or 'Melo, man.

1594
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:59,541
[Eddie] I drafted Darren
and I got Winston.

1595
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:02,250
[Gooey] This is, uh, KG, huh?

1596
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:06,958
-[Howard] Oh. Three for 11? What the fuck?
-Yeah, he looks tortured.

1597
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,458
That fucking guy tried
to steal an opal from me.

1598
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:10,708
Your opal came?

1599
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:12,208
-The opal came, yeah.
-Yeah?

1600
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,875
Yeah. Stupidly I lent it
to this motherfucker.

1601
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:16,541
No. What do you mean,
he took it? He stole it?

1602
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:20,625
He didn't steal it. He got carried away.
He thinks it has magic powers.

1603
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,083
Magic powers?

1604
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:23,416

1605
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,250
No, really?

1606
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,958
[Howard] Yeah. Look at him tonight.
Without it.

1607
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,166
He didn't have it tonight,
look how fucking bad he played.

1608
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,541
He wants to own it.

1609
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:32,333
So I tell him, "Come to the auction,

1610
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,541
fucking make a bid for it,
like everyone else."

1611
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:37,125
-[Gooey] So, when is this auction?
-[Howard] The auction is Monday.

1612
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,458
[Gooey] Uh-huh.
Okay, so what do you think it's worth?

1613
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:45,500
Well, listen, it's anywhere
from 1,000 to $3,000 a carat.

1614
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:46,583
And it's 600 carats.

1615
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:50,791
[exclaims] That's over
a million dollars. He's rich.

1616
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,833
-[Howard] Not as rich as Gooey, but...
-[Gooey laughing]

1617
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:54,791
I'm working on that.
That's a hard place...

1618
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:57,333
Who's comparing? Rich is rich.

1619
01:16:57,416 --> 01:17:01,625
I made a crazy risk, a gamble,
and it's about to pay off.

1620
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:02,708
[Gooey] Oh, man.

1621
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:04,375
[children chattering playfully]

1622
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:09,750
Uh-uh-uh. Don't look at us,
don't look at him,

1623
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,250
don't look at me, find it yourself.

1624
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,750
Come on, keep looking.

1625
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:16,416

1626
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:19,041

1627
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,000

1635
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:36,875

1636
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:40,166

dress. It still fits her.

1637

What do you think? Shall we get going?

1640
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:49,125
-Yeah, let's go tell the boys.
-I told them, I told them.

-Um...

-You look gorgeous.
-Oh, God.

1643
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,291
I wanted to talk to you for a minute.

1644
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:06,833
Just sit down
and we don't have to do it here.

1645
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:09,625
We'll wait, but I, uh...

I know I fucked up. I know I did.

I'm not having this conversation.

and just look at me.

1654

what I'm feeling.

I'll leave her. I don't need her.

We're done.

1665

-It's done.
-Okay. Okay.

-Say yes. What?

I hate looking at you.

I would never see you again.

You're mad and it makes sense.

I'll even break an increment for you, sir.

1919
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,833
Can I urge you to consider

Looking then for 110 in the room.
It's $100,000 now.

Wanna move this up.
Any higher? Any further?

1947

[KG] Relax. Relax.

1948

1961
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:16,208
[Gooey] All right.

1962
01:34:16,291 --> 01:34:18,958
-Gooey. I'm so goddamn sorry.

1963
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:21,000
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

1964
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:24,166
I'm sorry. Listen, I--

1965
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:27,041
49th Street, I'm supposed
to be on 48th Street.

1966
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,291
Thank you. Thank you.

1967
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,583
It's 190 grand, Howard.

1968
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,708
-190 grand.
-That's temporary.

1969
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:34,416
Hey, I'm sorry.

1970
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,375
I gotta tell you,
I was gonna stop past 200.

1971
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:39,083
Did I not tell you that was gonna happen?

1972
01:34:39,166 --> 01:34:40,583
-I'm sorry.
-So now what?

1973
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:44,666
Your money's gonna go into my account,
and I'll wire it right back to you.

1974
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,125
-Like it never happened.
-Including 20%?

1975
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,750
Absolutely. That comes
right out of my pocket.

1976
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:49,458
That is nearly 38 grand, Howard.

1977
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:50,833
-[Howard] I know that.
-That's 38 grand.

1978
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:53,500
So I'm gonna need a couple of weeks
on that, but it'll be done.

1979
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:56,166
-I promise you, okay?
-All right. Aaron, let's go.

1980
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,833
-[Aaron] I got like six autographs.
-[Gooey] Now!

1981
01:34:57,916 --> 01:34:59,916
-[Howard] All right--
-See you, Gooey.

1982
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,708
[Howard] You got the autographs?
That's great.

01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:02,833
[Aaron] Yeah.

1984
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:03,833

-[Howard] Don't be mad at me?
-Get in.

1987
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:09,125
Please? Please don't be mad.

1988
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:13,416
Come on. Can I get the opal?
Let me get the opal.

1989
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,750
-What for?
-Because I gotta sell that.

1990
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:17,333
-Take the fucking opal.
-Yes, all right.

1991
01:35:17,416 --> 01:35:19,041
-Thanks.
-[Gooey] Close the door.

1992
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,166
Get 'em going.
Open the fucking door.

What's he waiting for you for?

1994
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,958
Okay. All right.

I know, I know, I know. I know.

1996
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:32,875
Let 'em go, let 'em go
and then we'll talk.

1997
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:35,125
-The fuck was that?
-All right, I fucked up.

1998
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:38,666
I fucked up, it was a mistake, all right?
I know. I admit it.

1999
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:42,625
I gotta just... Let's hit pause
for one fucking second.

2000
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:46,000
Gonna call Kevin 'cause I know
he fucking wants it.

2001
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:51,791
And you saw he's got the 175 and then
everything will be copasetic.

2002
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:52,916
All right?

2003
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:57,125
KG. It's me.
I got great news for you. I--

2004

Hello?

2006
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,958

Just listen to me, please.

2017
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:34,791
I spoke to Demany, remember Demany?

2018
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:38,041
He's a business friend of mine.
He gave me the fucking number...

2019
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:40,833
That's enough, Howard!
That's fucking enough!

2020
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:43,208
[Howard] Why are you being
so thick headed? I don't--

2021

All right, fuck you, man. Suck my dick!
Throw him in the fucking water.

[Howard groans]

2023
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,333
All right, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

2024
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,583
Where the fuck are my glasses?

-I don't know if this is a $400 bag.
-Mm-hmm.

2029
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:51,791
[Julia] Maybe $250.

2030
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:53,250
[man] Howard! There he is. Howard!

2031

[Howard] What is it?

2043
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:16,500
I just wanted to see
how the auction went.

2044

-I don't wanna talk about it.
-[Julia] Okay.

Well, Damian and Joseph
brought this amazing sweat suit

Do you wanna see it?

I'm so sad. I'm so fucked up.

2060
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,458
I'm so fucked up.

2061
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,083
[tearfully] Yeah, I'm really upset too.

2062
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:08,041
I'm sorry if this is anything
to do with me,

2063
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,208
but I swear, I really didn't do anything.

2064
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:12,708
I wish you were nicer to me though.

2065
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:16,041
It was not nice what you did to me.

2066
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:18,166
I try, but it's really hard.

2067
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,916
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

2068
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,750
I don't have any place to go.
I don't have anywhere to get better.

2069
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:26,583
But you do.

2070
01:40:26,666 --> 01:40:31,000
Like, really, Howard, you're my home.
You could come to me.

2071
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,833
No, I don't-- I can't figure it out.

2072
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:36,583
I can't figure out
what I'm supposed to do.

2073
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:38,750
Everything I do is not going right.

2074
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:40,750
Everything I do is not going right.

2075
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:43,041
I don't know what to do.
I really don't.

2076
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,958
-I don't want any more of this shit.
-Yeah.

2077
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:47,458
-I really don't. I gotta figure this out.
-Yeah.

2078
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,500
I gotta figure this out, I really do.

2079
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:53,750
Well, I got something if you want.
But you can't make fun of me.

2080
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,333
What?

2081
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:56,708
[chuckles]

2082
01:40:56,791 --> 01:41:00,208
My God, it's so stupid, but...
I don't know... I got it, I thought...

2083
01:41:00,291 --> 01:41:02,500
I thought it would
make you feel better. [sniffles]

2084
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:04,083
Look, unzip my skirt.

2085
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:09,166
Not like that, just unzip my skirt.

2086
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:10,666
[chuckles]

2087
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:13,958
It says, "Howie."

2088
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:16,791
What did you do?
Why would you do that?

2089
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:18,250
[Julia] You don't like it?

2090
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:20,416
[Howard] No, I do. I'm not worth it.

2091
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,583
-Yes, you are worth it.
-I'm not worth it.

2092
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:25,625
-Look, Howie, I'm so crazy about you.
-I don't deserve this.

2093
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:27,750
Yes, you do. I love you.

2094
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:29,875
-No, no, you gonna...
-[chuckling] Yeah.

2095
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:31,291
You can't even get buried with me now.

2096
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:33,333
-Oh, it's okay.
-[doorbell chimes]

2097
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:38,333
Oh, this fucking guy.

2098
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:41,541
Do not let him in. Understand me?

2099
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,416
Just ignore him. Ignore him, Joani.

2100
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,291
-[doorbell continues chiming]
-[intercom beeps]

2101
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,583
[sniffles]

2102
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:50,416
-Let's get you clean.
-[groans]

2103
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:52,708
-[groaning]
-It's not broken, right?

2104
01:41:52,791 --> 01:41:54,541
You don't think it's broken, right?

2105
01:41:55,916 --> 01:41:58,791
This is crazy.
You can't be out here looking like this.

2106
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:01,833
-[sniffles]
-[Julia clicks tongue] Aw.

2107
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:04,833
[cell phone ringing]

2108
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:07,291
Can you answer that?

2109
01:42:07,791 --> 01:42:08,625
Hello?

2110
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:10,916
[on phone] <i>Oh, hi, this is Liz,</i>
<i>I work with Kevin.</i>

2111
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,041
<i>-I'm actually looking for Howard.</i>
-This is Howard.

2112
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:17,416
<i>Hi, yes, I got your message</i>
<i>from Demany about the gem.</i>

2113
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,916
<i>We're at the bank right now.</i>

2114
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,375
Oh. Did, uh... So does he want it?

2115
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:25,416
<i>Yes. Kevin's still interested.</i>
<i>We could actually be there--</i>

2116
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,083
It's like we discussed, right?

2117
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:30,708
It's still, uh... It's still 175, right?

2118
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:32,083
<i>-Yes.</i>
-In cash.

2119
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:33,916
<i>Yes, in cash. Like I said,</i>
<i>we're at the bank now.</i>

2120
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,666
-[KG] <i>Did you tell him we're at the bank?</i>
-[Liz] <i>Kevin, yes. I told you.</i>

2121
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,166
<i>-Howard, I gotta go.</i>
-Okay.

2122
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,625
<i>I'll see you soon. Goodbye.</i>

2123
01:42:41,541 --> 01:42:43,041
[Julia] You see? I told you.

2124
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:47,041
[Howard] Arno? Hey, listen, no bullshit,

2125
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:54,416
Kevin Garnett is coming to my office
right now with $175,000 cash. All right?

2126
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,208
You said I got till Monday.

2127
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:59,875
Today is still Monday
so I don't know if you're hearing this,

2128
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:01,541
but Arno, this is real.

2129
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:04,583
Kevin's really on the way.
He was just at the bank.

2130
01:43:04,666 --> 01:43:06,458
Come get your money, buddy.

2131
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:08,083
I need the Celtic ring back.

2132
01:43:08,166 --> 01:43:09,625
-What happened to Friday?
-I know.

2133
01:43:09,708 --> 01:43:11,375
-It's Monday, Howie.
-I know what we said.

2134
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:13,416
-What did we say?
-It was a short week. Pesach.

2135
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:14,958
What happened to your face?

2136
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:17,625
Car accident. Okay?

2137
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:18,750
-So let's--
-What do you need?

2138
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,541
[Howard] I need the Celtic ring,

2139
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:22,875
and I'm gonna give you
the Knicks ring. All right?

2140
01:43:22,958 --> 01:43:25,625
You know what that means.
Swap them out, please.

2141
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,125
You've had this Knicks ring forever.

2142
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:29,458
I just need the Celtic ring back.
All right?

2143
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:32,125
-[Steve] No, no. No.
-What do you wanna do?

2144
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:34,291
-I own that ring right now.
-I know, I know you do. And I'm--

2145
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:38,875
So, I'll swap you the two rings
but I'm gonna put a 15% vig on this one.

2146
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:40,125
And if you're not here by Friday,

2147
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:42,166
it's gonna be the same thing.
Not gonna have a third ring.

2148
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,583
Not gonna have to worry about that.

2149
01:43:43,666 --> 01:43:46,250
Make it a 16%,
I'm sorry I fucked you, all right?

2150
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:48,083
Bubby, what's going on? You okay?

2151
01:43:48,166 --> 01:43:50,250
I'm very good. Everything's going good.

2152
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:52,625
-Yeah.
-I promise you. I promise you.

2153
01:43:58,041 --> 01:44:00,250
Hey. There he is.

2154
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:03,791
KG! Don't you got a game tonight? [laughs]

2155
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:06,833
I got your chip right here, all right?
Game night.

2156
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:08,708
[Liz] We've really gotta go.
Can we make this quick?

2157
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:11,166
[Howard] You must be Liz?
We're gonna make it quick, absolutely.

2158
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:12,875
-[buzzer sounds]
-Julia,

2159
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,791
let's get these guys some Powerades.

2160
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,208
-Powerades?
-By the way...

2161
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:17,833
Water? Anything else?

2162
01:44:17,916 --> 01:44:19,375
[KG] That's fine, I'm okay. I'm good.

2163
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:22,416
-They're cold, you know that.
-Howard, let me get a second.

2164
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,208
-[Howard] Sure, sure. All right.
-[Liz] Need to be in Boston in 45 minutes.

2165
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:28,333
-[KG] I got it. Two seconds.
-[Liz] We need to be in Boston...

2166
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,500
-[Howard] That's my office.
-Let me holla at you, man.

2167
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:31,958
-Fuck's going on, man?
-[door closes]

2168
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:34,833
Ever since I met you, you've been giving
me the run around with everything.

2169
01:44:34,916 --> 01:44:35,791
What do you mean?

2170
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:39,500
Feel like you're fucking with my emotions.
You're just playing with me at some point.

2171
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,458
This hasn't been straight
since I came here.

2172
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:43,000
-You understand?
-Why are you saying that?

2173
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:45,958
I borrowed the opal is one thing,
I come back over here, I brought it back.

2174
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:48,375
I brought it back. I didn't have
to bring it back, you understand?

2175
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:49,750
I show up at the auction,

2176
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:51,875
you have somebody bid against me,
all these fucking games?

2177
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:53,458
What the fuck are you doing?

2178
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:56,125
You don't think I notice?
You don't think I know none of this?

2179
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:58,708
-It's complicated, KG.
-[sighs]

2180
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,166
You see this face, do you see it?

2181
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:02,958
Man, here's 165,000 right here. Cash.

2182
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:05,208
I'm showing you
because it wasn't easy, man.

2183
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:07,583
Six percent goes to Demany,
I've already taken that out, all right?

2184
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:09,208
All right, I guess that's fair.

2185
01:45:09,291 --> 01:45:11,500
Let me get the fucking opal, man.
Let me get the fuck up out of here.

2186
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:14,250
This opal's very valuable for you.

2187
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:15,833
-[KG] Absolutely.
-I did that.

2188
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:17,833
Get the fuck out...

2189
01:45:17,916 --> 01:45:20,333
[Howard] I respect you,
I respect your passion.

2190
01:45:20,416 --> 01:45:21,833
-[KG] Man.
-[Howard] Okay, I always have.

2191
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:24,750
-Thought you was a fan too, man.
-I'm a fucking huge fan.

2192
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:27,458
What'd you pay for this? Real shit.
What'd you pay for this right here?

2193
01:45:27,541 --> 01:45:29,875
That's not a fair question,
Kevin, all right?

2194
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:32,875
We're talking months and months
of fucking my time.

2195
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:35,166
I'm not gonna take the money back.
I mean, I did the deal now.

2196
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,916
I'm just saying. Straight up, me and you,

2197
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,208
-mano a mano.
-[doorbell chimes]

2198
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,625
How much you pay for this?

2199
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:43,750
Fuckin'... What'd I pay?
I paid a... This is...

2200
01:45:43,833 --> 01:45:45,833
-[buzzer sounds]
-I'm telling you, that's...

2201
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:48,208
If I answer that question,
it's very misleading.

2202
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:49,125
Why?

2203
01:45:49,916 --> 01:45:52,583
-I paid 100 grand, okay?
-So you doubled your money?

2204
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:55,708
[Howard] I'm the joke here,
all right? I got fucked.

2205
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:57,958
A million dollars is what
I was supposed to get.

2206
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:01,708
I get a fucking what? Made 65 Gs?

2207
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:04,666
You gave some niggas from Ethiopia
100 grand for something

2208
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:06,500
you thought was worth a million dollars.

2209
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:08,041
You don't see nothing wrong with that?

2210
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:10,875
Ethiopian miners,
you know what these fucking guys make?

2211
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:14,541
100 grand's 50 lifetimes
for these fucking guys.

2212
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:16,583
A million dollars is more,
that's my point. Understand?

2213
01:46:16,666 --> 01:46:20,958
Well, you wanna win by one point
or fucking 30 points, KG, right?

2214
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,250
I see you out there with the fucking
stadiums all booing you.

2215
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:26,958
You're 30 up,
you're still going full tilt.

2216
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:30,625
Let's see what Vegas...
What does Vegas got you guys at tonight?

2217
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:31,750
Take a look. Let's see.

2218
01:46:31,833 --> 01:46:34,083
Hold on, are you serious?
You're gonna pull this up right here?

2219
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:37,875
Look at this shit. The Sixers are supposed
to win the game tonight, they think.

2220
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:39,500
I don't keep track of none of that shit.

2221
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:42,958
They think on game seven,
you're not gonna get fucking 18 points.

2222
01:46:43,041 --> 01:46:44,708
They don't think
you're gonna get eight rebounds?

2223
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:46,208
These guys don't know shit about ball.

2224
01:46:46,291 --> 01:46:47,333
What the fuck do they do?

2225
01:46:47,416 --> 01:46:49,375
Doesn't that make you want
to fucking kill them?

2226
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:52,416
Doesn't that make you wanna say,
"Fuck you for doubting me"?

2227
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:56,916
Doesn't that make you wanna step on
fucking Elton Brand's fucking neck?

2228
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,083
Come on, KG, this is no different
than that. This is me.

2229
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:03,125
All right? I'm not a fucking athlete,

2230
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,583
this is my fucking way, this is how I win.

2231
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:09,166
All right?
All the fucking hard work I do,

2232
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:12,291
all the fucking ass kicking,
and the dues I pay.

2233
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:16,125
You're not gonna score
on the big one, on game seven?

2234
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:20,166
Fuck these people, right?
That's how you feel, I know you do.

2235
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,416
So, look...

2236
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:27,458
Let's fucking bet on this.
Let's bet on this shit.

2237
01:47:29,291 --> 01:47:32,291
I'm fucking gonna bet
all this money on you tonight, KG.

2238
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:36,416
You're here to win, KG.
These fuckers don't know.

2239
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:39,625
Them out fucking west,
do you think they fucking know you?

2240
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:41,833
They don't know you. They don't know us.

2241
01:47:41,916 --> 01:47:45,208
It's about fucking winning.
It's about you.

2242
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:50,833
And I saw your fucking conviction,
your fucking honesty.

2243
01:47:50,916 --> 01:47:52,958
And your fucking magic.

2244
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:55,250
[KG] Howard, you're fucking crazy, man.

2245
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:56,750
KG, do you even understand

2246
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:59,583
how fucking great of a game
you're gonna have tonight? I know it.

2247
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:02,750
-Listen...
-We're a team tonight, KG.

2248
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:05,833
This is a fucking lock-in.
It's a fucking feeling.

2249
01:48:05,916 --> 01:48:09,833
We both have it. They don't know.
You and I know, all right?

2250
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:12,375
-[cell phone chimes]
-[man] Nice fucking trim.

2251
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:18,958
-Nice fuckin' watch, too.
-[Julia sighs]

2252
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,083
What the fuck are...

2253
01:48:20,166 --> 01:48:23,333
Hey, do you mind watching the space
while I run to the bathroom?

2254
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:25,166
-Sure.
-Thank you.

2255
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,166
I can leave you guys alone in here?

2256
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,833
Go handle your business, sweetheart.

2257
01:48:28,916 --> 01:48:29,916
Do you want company?

2258
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,125
I don't think so, but next time maybe.

2259
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:34,583
[buzzer sounds]

2260
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:38,083
Hey, hey, hey. I'm looking for Howard.

2261
01:48:38,666 --> 01:48:41,000
-I'm sorry, we're closed.
-He gave me a fucking fake Rolex.

2262
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:43,000
I'm sorry, I don't know anything
about that, sir.

2263
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:44,833
Please calm down.
I don't know anything about that.

2264
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,666
Let me talk to you about this.
You gotta help me.

2265
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:47,708
I'm sorry, I'm busy.

2266
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:51,208
This is gonna be one of the best nights
of our fucking life.

2267
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,625
Howard. Howard.

2268
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,208
Come on. Come on.

2269
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:03,958
Come on, come on.
Where are you? Hey.

2270
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:05,208
Howard, what the fuck
is going on?

2271
01:49:05,291 --> 01:49:06,166
-Take this.
-What is this?

2272
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:07,375
I need you to listen to me carefully.

2273
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,125
I booked you on a blade, okay? You're
gonna land on top of the Mohegan Sun.

2274
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:12,250
Okay.

2275
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:14,041
There's a bet in that bag.

2276
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:15,583
I want you to take all of it,

2277
01:49:15,666 --> 01:49:18,208
all of it inside the bag
and place it on that bet.

2278
01:49:18,291 --> 01:49:20,083
-How much is in the bag?
-There's a lot.

2279
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:22,000
I don't want you to think about that.
All right?

2280
01:49:22,083 --> 01:49:25,000
I don't even look at it
until you get there, and you take it out,

2281
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:26,041
and give it to the teller.

2282
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:27,333
-Understand?
-I got it.

2283
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:29,458
I'm gonna fuck the living shit
out of you tonight.

2284
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:30,958
-You know that?
-I wish I could kiss you.

2285
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:32,583
-You gotta go.
-[Julia] Okay.

2286
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:35,458
-Get going. Get going.
-All right, love you. Bye.

2287
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:38,083
[Julia] Thank you, guys. Thank you.

2288
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,041
See you, guys.

2289
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:43,500
[buzzer sounds]

2290
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:46,833
Let's get this over with.

2291
01:49:46,916 --> 01:49:49,541
Arno. You're never
gonna believe this shit.

2292
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:51,041
Believe what?

2293
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:53,458
We're about to hit so goddamn big.

2294
01:49:53,541 --> 01:49:55,875
KG was just here. You saw him, right?

2295
01:49:55,958 --> 01:49:59,916
I gave him the gem. He's gonna fuck up
the money line so bad tonight.

2296
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,833
Howard, where's the money right now?

2297
01:50:01,916 --> 01:50:04,791
It's on the way right now.
It's on the way to the casino.

2298
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:07,208
-[Arno] What are you talking about?
-Buddy!

2299
01:50:07,291 --> 01:50:09,083
[Buddy] What the fuck
is going on in there?

2300
01:50:09,166 --> 01:50:11,125
-Girl that went to the bathroom?
-I ain't seen her.

2301
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:12,833
-She didn't get back here?
-No.

2302
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:15,291
-[Howard] What are you not getting?
-No, it's in this room right now.

2303
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:18,166
Go get her now. Bring her back.

2304
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:19,833
-Hey. Hit the buzzer.
-Open the fucking door!

2305
01:50:19,916 --> 01:50:22,458
For what? What am I opening the door for?

2306
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:24,083
-Come and buzz me out.
-[Nico] I got it.

2307
01:50:24,166 --> 01:50:26,208
-What are they doing?
-[Buddy] Let's go.

2308
01:50:26,291 --> 01:50:28,166
-[Phil] No. Listen.
-[Arno] You're saying what?

2309
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,458
Get your hands off me.
What the fuck are we doing?

2310
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:34,291
It's gonna make sense to you in about
two fucking minutes. Listen to what--

2311
01:50:34,375 --> 01:50:36,791
-I'm listening.
-You're gonna do what I tell you.

2312
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:39,875
Listen, you fucking goon,
I'm telling you something good--

2313
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:41,125
-Listen.
-[Phil] Come here.

2314
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:42,541
-[Howard] Arno?
-[Phil] Come here.

2315
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:44,791
-[indistinct shouting]
-[Howard] Arno, Arno.

2316
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:47,500
[Phil] Get the fucking machine now!

2317
01:50:47,583 --> 01:50:49,541
[Howard] I wanna give you your money.

2318
01:50:49,625 --> 01:50:52,291
[Phil] Shut the fuck up!
I'll show you how.

2319
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:56,666
Hey, come on, come on.

2320
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:57,916
[Howard] No, no, no!

2321
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,541
-[screaming]
-Got your attention now?

2322
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:02,708
I'll drop you on your fucking head!
You hear me?

2323
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:03,916
Gimme the word. I let him go.

2324
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,833
-I got kids, help me up.
-You gonna call him?

2325
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:09,375
-I'll call! Please.
-Get that bitch down here now!

2326
01:51:09,458 --> 01:51:11,708
-All right, take me up.
-[Phil] Get him up.

2327
01:51:11,791 --> 01:51:13,041
-Get him up.
-[groaning]

2328
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:14,791
There you go.

2329
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:19,125
Listen to me.
Get yourself together. All right?

2330
01:51:19,208 --> 01:51:22,083
Yeah, I want you to make that call.
You hear me?

2331
01:51:22,791 --> 01:51:24,666
Give me a fucking second, please.

2332
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:27,125
You have plenty of time.
After you make the call.

2333
01:51:27,208 --> 01:51:28,041
My heart.

2334
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:30,875
[Phil] Call this girl up,
I want her back here now.

2335
01:51:30,958 --> 01:51:32,166
[cell phone chimes]

2336
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:36,541
She's in Mohegan Sun.

2337
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:38,750
[Nico] Yeah, come on. Let's go.

2338
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,291
-Put it on speaker.
-[dial tone sounds]

2339
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:46,541
-[dialing]
-There we go.

2340
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:51,125
This motherfucker...

2341
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:55,291
Come on, come on.

2342
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,458
[breathing heavily]

2343
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,875
-[Howard] I can't, I'm sorry.
-[Phil] This fucking guy. Unbelievable.

2344
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:07,708
I'm sorry. I really am. I am sorry.

2345
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:14,041
I mean, fuck this!

2346
01:52:15,125 --> 01:52:16,208
You're a moron.

2347
01:52:16,291 --> 01:52:18,375
-[Phil] I'll do it. Are you kidding me?
-[Nico] Fuck him.

2348
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:20,750
[Phil] He's not worth it.
Put that shit away.

2349
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:22,041
-What are you doing?
-[Arno] Buzz us out.

2350
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:24,666
What are you doing? Why am I
buzzing? Why are you going?

2351
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:25,791
Just buzz me the fuck out.

2352
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:28,041
-Watch the fucking game.
-Buzz me the fuck out.

2353
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:29,958
-You'll be happy with the results.
-Buzz me out.

2354
01:52:30,041 --> 01:52:32,916
I'm telling you now, before I put
your head through the fucking glass.

2355
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,458
All right, I'll buzz you out.
I'll buzz you out. All right?

2356
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:37,583
-[buzzer sounds]
-Fuck it.

2357
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:41,416
Now close that door. Close it.

2358
01:52:42,208 --> 01:52:43,708
Come on, buzz me out.

2359
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:46,750
What are you doing?

2360
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:49,541
-[door rattling]
-Open the fucking door.

2361
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:51,375
-Come on.
-[banging on door]

2362
01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:53,833
-This cocksucker.
-[Arno] Howard, open the door.

2363
01:52:53,916 --> 01:52:55,625
[doorbell chimes]

2364
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:58,416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm not buzzing you out.

2365
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,375
Arno, Arno.

2366
01:53:00,458 --> 01:53:02,625
-The Sixers shouldn't even be there.
-[knocking on door]

2367
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:03,625
You understand?

2368
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:05,791
[Arno] No, no,
she's at the Mohegan Sun sportsbook.

2369
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:10,083
[Phil] Mohegan Sun sportsbook.
Get over... Get over there now.

2370
01:53:10,166 --> 01:53:11,958
You know what she looks like, find her.

2371
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,875
They're gonna get
to the guard and fold...

2372
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:15,083
Howard. Open the door!

2373
01:53:15,166 --> 01:53:17,083
-I know you're upset, Arno.

That doesn't work.

-You better open this fucking door.
-[Howard] Listen to me.

You know? Who is that?
Who are you talking to?

There's a gas leak on Pinoak.

You and the kids go to Amy's.

<i>-Why'd they call the office...</i>
-Stay at Amy's.

So, you wanna parlay three ways.

2429

Make sure when you put it in,
it's exactly that.

I will. How much you want on it?
